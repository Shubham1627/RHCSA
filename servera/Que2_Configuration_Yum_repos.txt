About Question:
For installation of any package, configuration of yum repositories is very important, In question we get two urls 
to configure BaseOS and AppStream with following syntax and flags.

[root@servera~]# vim /etc/yum.repos.d/rhel.repos (create repo file with name 'rhel.repo' at that location)

          [BaseOS]
          name= BaseOS
          baseurl= http://content.example.com/rhel8.0/x86_64/dvd/BaseOS/
          enabled= true
          gpgcheck= false


          [AppStream]
          name= AppStream
          baseurl=http://content.example.com/rhel8.0/x86_64/dvd/AppStream/
          enable= true
          gpgcheck= false   


[root@servera~]# yum repolist all  (verify the staus 'enabled')


Note: This is very Important question, configuring the repositories correctly is very important 
      as this is responsible to install any package.
