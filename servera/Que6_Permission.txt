 Create a collaborative Directory.
- Create the Directory "/home/manager" with the following characteristics.
- Group ownership of "/home/manager" should go to "sysadms" group.
- The directory should have full permission for all members of 
  "sysadms" group but not to the other users except "root".
- Files created in future under "/home/manager" should get the 
  same group ownership

  [root@servera~]# mkdir /home/manager
  chgrp sysadms /home/manager
  [root@servera~]# ll -ld /home/manager

  [root@servera~]#chmod u+rwx,g+rwx,o-rwx /home/manager 
  [root@servera~]#chmod g+s /home/manager
