About Question :
We do entire this question on console(Know the difference between console and terminal) then give ssh permission and move to terminal.
because first we need to configure servera ip on which we are suppose to do remaining work. 

ANS:

step1:
nmcli connection (Display all network connections)
Wired connection 1 ..........(with green highlight means it is up )

step2:
nmcli connection modify "Wired  connection 1" connection.autoconnect yes ipv4.addressess 172.250.25.10/24 ipv4.gateway 172.250.25.254 ipv4.dns 172.250.25.254 ipv4.method manual ipv4.dns-search lab.example.com
    

step:3
hostnamectl set-hostname servera.lab.example.com

step4:
nmcli connection up "Wired connection 1"


Note : after above stuff done on node 1 we need to configure ssh as ,
        PermitRootLogin yes   (Enable permission to login uncomment it by removing '#' )
      in order to ssh login into servera via terminal for efficiency

       [root@oworkstation ~]# systemctl restart sshd
        The next we can able to access it on terminal by 

       [root@workstation ~]# ssh root@our_set_ip
       [root@our_set_hostname ~]# (Solve next questions onwards...)
